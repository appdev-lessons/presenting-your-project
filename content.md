## Guidelines and Tips For Your Presentation

The goal is to present what you've been working on and what you've gained throughout the course. On your first slide, include your name and anything else that you want to be displayed while you're walking up to the stage. Aim to keep your presentation ~3-5 minutes. Practice with another trainee, TA, and/or in front of a mirror.

A good baseline structure for presenting your project is **YOU** - **PROBLEM** - **SOLUTION**:

1. Introduce yourself
2. Describe the problem you're trying to solve (a personal anecdote of experiencing the problem is good)
3. Jump into the screencast of the solution you built.

### Presentation Demo

<!-- TODO: add link to presentations that did this well -->
Record a demo of your application for your presentation. Don't bother including the sign-up/sign-in steps in the video; those will be the same for everyone. Be signed in already and jump straight into the unique parts of the app. Don't show every single user flow. We don't need to see that you can edit and delete all the things — that is assumed. Focus in on the most interesting/useful flows, or places that were tricky/you're particularly proud of.

<aside>

If you're on a Mac, you can record your screen with QuickTime.

On Windows 11, you can press the `print screen` key on your keyboard to open the Snipping Tool app to make a screen recording, and then edit the video in Microsoft Clipchamp or another app of your choice. On other platforms, you can use [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/).
</aside>

It's always nice when demoing for the app to look attractive. Perhaps it's unfair but it's a fact that people don't give as much credit to the same functionality if it doesn't look good. I'm happy to help with CSS/Bootstrap; come grab me (or an assistant) and we can pair program.

<aside>
<!-- zoom / accessibility -->

Before you start recording a screencast, adjust your browser's zoom level to make things as big as you can without making them look awkward.

If you want to also zoom in on just a portion of the screen, the way I do in class, on Mac you enable it in Accessibility Settings:

After you check the box for "Use scroll gesture with modifier key to zoom", you should be able to hold Control while scrolling up and down to zoom in and out.

## General public speaking tips
In your slides, avoid writing out every word that you plan to say. If there's too much text on a slide, your audience will stop paying attention to what you're saying and instead will read the slide.

Instead, consider short bullet points. I use these all the time to help me remember what I mean to say, and in what order. But I keep the prompts pretty short, and I use my words to expand.

It can sometimes be hard to conclude a presentation. Consider ending with a firm "Thank you" (as opposed to rambling on for longer than you intend and then closing with "okay I guess that's it!"). Add a closing slide that says "Thank you" to remind yourself of this.

If you forget something you wanted to say, or can't think of a word you want to use, don't panic. Just keep going — your audience will never know, and won't miss a thing.

## Be Confident
Most importantly: remember that it will be a room full of people who are already your fans. Try not to stress (I know it's hard), and try to have fun with it!

Feel free to pepper us with questions or requests for feedback. Make sure to book time with a TA to practice.

## Guidelines and Tips For Your Landing Page Demo Video

You will record a very brief (2-5 minute) screencast talking me through your application. What is the name? What problem does it solve? Who is it for? How does it solve this problem? Imagine that in the future some day you will interview for a position as a product manager, and this screencast will be your way of demonstrating that you rolled up your sleeves and learned how to code at one point.

In the screencast, demonstrate the critical, unique flows in your application. You don't have to walk me through signing-up and signing-in as each user; those are not unique flows. It's usually helpful to pre-create some users and other sample data before starting your recording.

You can use any recording method you like:

- You could record a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) call where you are the only participant and sharing your screen.
- [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) is a free Chrome extension.
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is also a great option.

Once recorded, upload the video file to YouTube, Dropbox, Google Drive, or whatever service you prefer; but whatever you choose, you must be able to share a link with us **that does not require signing in**. In other words, **anyone with the link** should be able to view the video. On YouTube, this is known as an Unlisted (not Private) video.
